		<h2>Week 1 Interview Questions</h2>

			
			<div id="Q1">
			1) What is the difference between HTML and XTML?
				Insert answer:
				-	EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
				-	Strict HTML for less leeway in coding; HTML + XML
				-	XHTML is strict so to allow smaller devices (ie: tablets & smartphones) with less computing power to receive “proper” HTML coding

				
				
			</div>

			<div id="Q2">
			2) Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS links between HTML head tags and JavaScript script tags just before the html body tag? Do you know any exceptions?
				Insert answer:			
				-	It is for a better user experience; so that the viewer is seeing a completed version of the page when it finishes rendering instead of waiting while the page is loading.  
				-	HTML4 specifies that <link> is to be coded between <head></head>

				

			</div>

			<div id="Q3">
			3) What is the difference between classes and ID's in CSS?
				Insert answer:
				-	ID: can only be invoked once, specify one specific tag/DIV
				-	Class: used to encompass a bigger group; categorize

				

			</div>

			<div id="Q4">
			4) Describe Floats and how they work.
				Insert answer:
				-	decimal number with digits on either side of the decimal point
				-	fractions


				
			</div>

			<div id="Q5">
			5) What's the difference between a relative, fixed, absolute, and statically positioned element?
				Insert answer:
				-	Statically: the default position, where it normally is
				-	Relative: setting it so that the position is relative to where it normally is
				-	Fixed, fixed position on  a page, even if you scroll, it will not move
				-	Absolute: it is setting the location exactly where you want it on the page, in relative to the bigger div

				
				
			</div>		

		<h2>Week 2 Interview Questions</h2>

			
			<div id="Q1">
			1) What's the difference between "==" and "==="?
				Insert answer:
				-	“==” is value (type coercion) and “===” is both value and type (strictly equality operator)
				
				
			</div>

			<div id="Q2">
			2) Have you used Sass? What's good about it?
				Insert answer:			
				-	Yes, creates the CSS file mirroring a similar structure to the HTML file; easily reference style changes for DIVs; organize and picture changes better with respect to HTML
				

			</div>

			<div id="Q3">
			3) Explain how "this" works in JavaScript?
				Insert answer:
				-	refers to the context to which you are in; the object that you are in
				

			</div>

			<div id="Q4">
			4) When would you use "document.write()?
				Insert answer:
				-	good for testing when wanting to write directly onto HTML with JS while document is loading; 

				
			</div>

			<div id="Q5">
			5) Explain how GitHub works?
				Insert answer:
				-	web-based Git repository used to keep track of developments in code and for sharing/collaboration with peers; can branch to create multiple variations from the same root code
