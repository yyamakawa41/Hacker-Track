//a) Write a function that would return an array of all the odd numbers between 1 to 50. (ex. [1,3,5, .... , 47,49]). Hint: Use 'push' method.
	arr = [];
	function oddNumbers() {
   		//Place your code here 
   		for (i=1; i<50; i+=2){
   			arr.push(i);
   		}
   		return arr; 
	}
	oddNumbers();

//b) Given an array x (e.g. [1,5, 10, -2]), create an algorithm (sets of instructions) that squares each value in the array. When the program is done x should have values that have been squared (e.g. [1, 25, 100, 4]). You're not to use any of the pre-built function in Javascript. You could for example square the value by saying x[i] = x[i] * x[i];.
	var arr = [-41,-14,1,3,5,41,7,8,14]
	function squareVal(arr) {
   		//Place your code here 
   		var squareArr = [];
   		for (i=0; i < arr.length; i++){
   			squareArr.push(arr[i]*arr[i]);
   		}
   		return squareArr; 
	}
	squareVal(arr);
